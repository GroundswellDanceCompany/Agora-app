# Agora

**Agora** is a civic web app that captures how people *really feel* about the news—by filtering Reddit comments and allowing users to participate in the emotional pulse of public headlines.

Inspired by the ancient Greek agora—the public square where citizens debated, disagreed, and discovered shared understanding—this app brings that spirit into the digital age.
